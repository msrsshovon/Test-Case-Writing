# Test_Case

The test case is defined as a group of conditions under which a tester determines whether a software application is working as per the customer's requirements or not. Test case has a set of test data, preconditions, expected results and postconditions, developed for a particular test scenario in order to verify compliance against a specific requirement.

# Bug_Report

A Bug Report in Testing is a detailed document about bugs found in the software application. Bug report contains each detail about bugs like description, date when bug was found, name of tester who found it, name of developer who fixed it, etc.

# Test_Metrics

Test Metrics is defined as a quantitative measure that helps to estimate the progress and quality of a software testing process. A metric is defined as the degree to which a system or its component possesses a specific attribute.
